def set_features(item, category, keywords):
    """Sets features modeling the current state (condition) of an Item.

    These data attributes represent the item's important features within
    the fiction/game world. The values held in particular entries are
    changed by Modify actions. The location and configuration of an item
    in the overall context of the world (what parent it has and what its link
    to the parent is) is not represented here. That aspect of the world is
    changed by Configure instead of Modify. These features model the item
    itself, not where it is located.

    The built-in features, represented by data attributes, are:

    article: string
        The initial article to use. "a" will be adjusted to "an" if
        necessary when text is generated.

    called: string
        What the item can be called when text is generated.

    referring: string | None
        Additional words that can be typed to refer to the item. Optional words
        first, separated by spaces; then "|", then space-delimited names. If 
        referring is the '' (the empty string, which is the default), there are 
        no special words added, but the item can still be referred to by words
        derived from its category and qualities. For the special case in which
        there should be no way to refer to an item, set referring to None.

    qualities: list of strings
        Terms describing the item; synonyms of these are used in recognition
        and the terms can be used in simulation.

    gender: 'female' | 'male' | 'neuter'
        Whether the item should be referred to as a she, he, or it.

    glow: float
        How much light the item is radiating, typically in (0, 1).
        Can be set outside of (0, 1) for supernatural reasons.

    number: 'singular' | 'plural'
        Whether the item should be referred to in the singular or plural.

    prominence: float
        How visible or noticeable an item is, typically in (0, 1).

    transparent: True | False
        Can one see through the item and see what is inside?

    mention: True | False
        Should the item ever be mentioned (for instance, in lists)? Almost
        everything should be, but not, for instance, part of another item 
        that is described in the main description of the parent item.

    allowed: can.function(tag, link, world)
        Determines what an item can contain. Specifically, returns whether
        the item 'tag' can be a child of the parent, in the specified link
        relationship, given the situation of world.

    shared: list of strings
        If a Room, the tags of SharedThings that this Room has; otherwise [].

    sight: string
        Template that produces a description of what an agent sees when
        looking at an item.

    touch: string
        Template that produces a description of what an agent feels when
        touching at an item. Should be able to complete the sentence
        "The adventurer feels ..." or "You feel ..."

    hearing: string
        Simimlar template for hearing.

    smell: string
        Simimlar template for hearing.

    taste: string
        Simimlar template for taste."""

    However, all SharedThings will have an attribute "sharedthing" that is set
    to True. Testing hasattr(item, 'sharedthing') will determine if the item is
    a SharedThing.

    SharedThing is provided to allow implementation of things like the sky, the
    sun, or a massive wall of the sort the United States has erected along the
    US/Mexico border. Becasue shared things are meant to represent these sorts
    of entities, they have an allowed expression that always returns False.
    Nothing can be placed in one, on one, through one, be part of one, or be 
    held by one. If it were possible, for instance, to place a sticker on a 
    massive border wall, this implementation would make the sticker visible in
    every room along the border, which makes no sense.
